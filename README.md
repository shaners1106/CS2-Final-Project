# Monopoly

This project was my final project for my CS2 course at Whitworth University.  It was an introductory project in object oriented programming, separation of header and implementation files, polymorphism and inheritance,  error handling, vectors, and file I/O. 

## Player.h and Player.cpp

The Player files create Player objects that define program users who engage with playing the Monopoly game

## Board.h and Board.cpp

The Board files define the Monopoly playing environment.  This Monopoly game is a scaled-down version of traditional Monopoly with about half of the original game's properties, utilities and railroads.

## cellClass.h and cellClass.cpp

The cellClass files incorporates polymorphism into the project.  cellClass.h establishes a Property base class with House, Utilities and Railroad subclasses.  These files define the Monopoly boardgame locations.

## Card.h and Card.cpp

The Card files define the various Monopoly game cards that come into play.

## Source.cpp

The Source file contains the main program loop that provides game rules, prompts the users to choose the token that they want to be throughout the game, and runs through the alternating player turns.
